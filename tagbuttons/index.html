        <h1>About Mariah Carey</h1>
        <p> These are 12 fun facts about Mariah Carey. </p>
        <p> 1. Mariah Carey’s name was inspired by music.
Carey was named after They Call The Wind Mariah, a song from the musical Paint Your Wagon. Her full name is Mariah Angela Carey. She was born in Huntington, New York, on March 27, 1970, to an Irish-American mother Patricia Hickey and an African American/Venezuelan father Alfred Roy Carey. </p>
        <p> 2. Mariah used to cut class.
She cut class so often in high school that she got the nickname Mirage! See, she’s also just a normal human being… </p>
        <p> 3. Mariah kept her singer-songwriter works a secret from her mom.
Her mother was a mezzo-soprano New York City opera singer and a freelance vocal coach. Though introducing Mariah to classical opera, Patricia never pressured her to pursue a career in it, as she never seemed interested. She said Patricia had "never been a pushy mom. She never said, 'Give it more of an operatic feel'. I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me." </p>
        <p> 4. Mariah studied cosmetology in Manhattan before making it big.
To afford her rent she worked a number of odd jobs to support herself, including hat/coat-checker, hostess, hair sweeper in hairdressing salons, and waitress. </p>
        <p> 5. The story behind Mariah’s big break has been described as a modern day Cinderella tale.
In December 1988, Carey accompanied Brenda K. Starr to a record executives' gala, where she handed her demo tape to the head of Columbia Records, Tommy Mottola, who listened to it on his way back home. After the first two songs, he was so enamoured of Carey's voice that he returned to the event, only to find that she had left. After searching for Carey for two weeks, he immediately signed her. (She went on to marry Mottola in 1993!) </p>
        <p> 6. Mariah's fans are known as her "Lambily."
According to the Lambily website, Mariah started calling her loved ones, friends, and fans "lambs" in 2000. It originated as a term of endearment but has been speculated that it refers to her fans acting like lambs — following the leader. </p>
        <p> 7. Mariah holds the record for the longest-running number one song in history together with Boyz II Men.
The song, One Sweet Day, spent 16 weeks in the top position on the Billboard Hot 100. The band and Carey wrote the song together. And interestingly enough, Mariah has writing and producing credits on almost all of her recorded material, an uncommon practice among many female pop stars.</p>
        <p> 8. Mariah’s dogs live better lives than most people.
She has eight jack russell terriers. Their names are: The Good Reverend Pow Jackson, Mutley P Gore Jackson The Third, Jill E Beans, Pipitty Jackson, Cha, Jackie Lambchops, JJ and Squeak E Beans. From spending £28 000 a year on spa treatments for them to flying them all by private jet for a five-star "canine vacation" at the luxury Paw Seasons doggie hotel in Bristol, where she gave staff personalised daily menus to follow for each of them, Mariah’s dogs are living the life! </p>
        <p> 9. Mariah has a five octave range, which is two octaves higher than normal soprano.
She also has the ability to reach notes beyond the 7th octave. Referred to as the "songbird supreme" by the Guinness World Records, she was ranked first in a 2003 MTV and Blender magazine countdown of the 22 Greatest Voices in Music, as voted by fans and readers in an online poll. </p>
        <p> 10. Mariah suffered a physical and emotional breakdown in 2001.
She spent two weeks recovering in a Connecticut mental hospital, two months before the release of Glitter. The cause was extreme exhaustion. The height of her decline was a bizarre appearance on MTV’s TRL. She showed up unannounced, started to strip off her clothes and said, "If you don’t have ice cream in your life, sometimes you just might go a little bit crazy," to which host Carson Daly responded, "That’s a metaphor for a lot more, I’m sure." </p>
        <p> 11. Mariah's song Obsessed is directed at Eminem.
He claimed the two had a sexual relationship, although she denied it and said they just spent time together. Eminem has directly referenced songs: "What you trying be? My new wife? / What, you Mariah? Fly through twice" on Superman and on When The Music Stops suggested that he would "beg Mariah to take [him] back" before censoring his lyrics.</p>
        <p> 12. Mariah once demanded 20 white kittens and 100 white doves as part of her rider.
When City Press asked Justin van Wyk, the CEO of Big Concerts, about any backstage demands the singer may have made for SA shows, he replied by e-mail: "I’m not at liberty to disclose them but I can say that Mariah Carey is the Diva of all Divas." </p>

        <h1>About Beyonce</h1>
            <p> These are 7 fun facts about Beyonce </p>
            <p> 1. Beyoncé is the most nominated woman in Grammy history and has won 22 of the gold-plated gramophones (as a solo artist and with Destiny's Child) so far in her career.</p>
        <p> 2. Her biggest musical influence is Michael Jackson, whom she diligently studied and imitated as a young girl. "Michael Jackson changed me, and helped me to become the artist I am. Thank you Michael," she wrote on her website on the five-year anniversary of his death.</p>
        <p> 3. Growing up, kids in school made fun of her ears, claiming they were "bigger than her head."</p>
        <p> 4. Beyoncé's name is a tweaked version of her mother Tina's maiden name Beyincé. Through her mother's Louisiana Creole background, Beyoncé has a mix of African, French, Native American and Irish ancestry. She is also a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard who was considered a hero in the 18th-century French and Indian Wars.</p>
        <p> 5. In the early 2000s Beyoncé created her alter ego "Sasha Fierce" to remind herself that her stage persona is distinctly different from who she really is. But in 2010 she admitted she didn't need to make the distinctions anymore since she was older and had a stronger sense of herself. "I'm now able to merge the two," she stated.</p>
        <p> 6. In 2007 she appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Issue, making her the first non-supermodel and non-athlete to grace its coveted front page.</p>
        <p> 7. Beyoncé's favorite number is four. Not only did she title her fourth studio album "4," but aside from her own birthday, her mother and Jay-Z were also born on the 4th day — of April and December, respectively. Furthermore, she and Jay got their ring fingers tattooed with the Roman numeral "IV" which also can be spotted in Blue Ivy's name.</p>
